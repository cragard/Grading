The goal of this script is to read csvs from a folder into r and :
- standardize column names
- add a column to label the exam
- generate a list of the most frequently incorrectly answered items of a given exam
- generate summary statistics within an exam
- generate inferential statistics within an exam
- generate summary statistics/figures across exams
- generate inferential statistics across exams
- compare summary statistics/figures across exams 

First we must set up the environment.
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
